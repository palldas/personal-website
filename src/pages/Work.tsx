    description: 'During my internship at Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) on the Cloud Platform Engineering Team, I had the opportunity to work on impactful projects that optimized cloud infrastructure and enhanced AI-driven workflows. I developed a custom Terraform web module with AWS EC2 and an Auto Scaling Group, automating resource management and significantly reducing cloud costs during peak customer usage. Additionally, I improved the performance of one of PG&Eâ€™s GenAI chatbots by integrating function calling with Amazon Bedrock Converse API, Claude Sonnet 3.5 LLM, Python, and Boto3, enabling faster, automated decision-making. I also automated the detection of outdated Terraform modules across 600+ workspaces using a Python script and the Terraform Cloud API, improving system stability and version control. This experience deepened my skills in cloud computing, automation, and AI integration, all while contributing to real-world solutions at PG&E.',

    description: "As a Junior Developer at the AWS DxHub, I've worked with various customers to build scalable solutions using the latest technologies to solve important challenges in the public sector. I built an innovative Media Search Finder for the World Bank utilizing AWS Amplify, Kendra, Transcribe, Lambda, S3, and Python scripts. This tool introduced speaker detection and timestamping features, which led to a 90% reduction in content search time. Additionally, I streamlined operational response times by 40% for the Seattle Police Department in collaboration with Accenture by developing an Emergency Call Classifier. This classifier, built with React.js, AWS Comprehend for natural language processing (NLP), DynamoDB, and WebSocket API, significantly enhanced real-time incident management capabilities.",

    description: "I developed a full-stack, block-based programming platform using TypeScript and React.js, incorporating real-time collaborative capabilities through WebSockets. This platform allows teachers to monitor and interact with students effectively, resulting in a 70% increase in student engagement. To enhance the platform's reliability and user experience, I utilized a Firebase back-end database for seamless authentication, storage, and deployment. This approach contributed to an 83% rise in interest in computer science among underrepresented students. Additionally, I led the integration of the Bilingual Networked Robotics Teaching Platform into local elementary and middle schools, which expanded access to over 150 students and significantly improved computational thinking education throughout San Luis Obispo.",
